# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Requirements


In order to use Vite, you need to have Node.js installed. As of Vite 5.0, at least Node version 18 or later is required, and it's a good idea to run the latest long term support (LTS) version when you can. As of 24th October 2023, Node 20 is the latest LTS version. Node includes npm (the Node package manager).

To check your version of Node, run the following in your terminal:
node -v

If Node is installed, you'll see a version number.

Installation Instructions: Clearly explain how to install the framework or library. for React, you can use npm (Node Package Manager) to install it. Here's an example:
npm install react

This project uses React for the front-end. To start the development server, run:

npm i install
